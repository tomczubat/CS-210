# CS-210

The purpose of this project was to display two clocks, a 12-hour and a 24-hour, on the screen at the same time. It would show a menu and allow the user to continue to enter different inputs until quit was selected. This program also allows a user to add an hour, minute, or second to each clock. I think I did a good job of organizing my code in the three different files and I believe that I have good comments to explain ewhat is going on. I think I oculd enhance my code by becoming more familiar with the libraries to implement time so there could be a way for the program to run faster possibly. I thought implementing the time library was pretty dificult and took me a while to figure out so I looked at the article that was provided to me as well as looking up documentation online to look at examples on how to make this work. A skill that I leaned from this project would be learning on the fly because I had to implment a library that I was not familiar with and this can be the case for a future project where I have to use something that I am not familiar with, so I would to read through articles and the documentation to figure it out. I believe that my program is very maintainable because it is seprated in three files and I made good use of whitespace and comments to make it look very readable and maintainable.
